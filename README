A reference implementation of stable link entity network for
PostgreSQL/PostGIS

A stable link entity network is a topological network allowing
use of linear referencing for both attribute data and location
for link connections.

The purpose for allowing a link to connect to another link at
a linear location is that the latter link does not have to
be split as would be the case in traditional node-link networks.

A mandatory attribute data in the model is from and to date
for links. This allows for discontinuation of no longer existing 
parts of links, again without requiring any change to link
geometry.

The above results in links that essentially live forever with
stable identities that can be be used to linearly reference
attribute data in disconnected distributed databases.

One use case is road networks with connected links and overlapping
attribute data owned and managed by separate organisations.
